Nathan is a data manager and analyst in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at AUT University.

He originally trained as a physicist at the University of Auckland, before working at Auckland City Hospital as a Medical Physics Registrar. During this period, he obtained his Master's degree in Medical Physics at the University of Canterbury. 

He is currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Psychology, working on a novel intervention for pornography addiction. His broader interest is in the mathematical modelling of addiction pathways, with a focus on the real world applications of such models.
