Nathan is a postdoctoral research associate within the Human Factors and Applied Cognition lab, where he is developing novel paradigms for attentional control training to enhance the performance of submarine operators. His broader interests lie in the intersection between human psychology and digital technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Nathan's doctoral research explored the psychological impact of Internet and pornography addiction, employing novel mathematical models to quantify the emotional dynamics produced by these behaviors. He previously worked as a data manager and analyst at Auckland University of Technology, providing statistical support within the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences.

He originally trained as a physicist at the University of Auckland, before working at Auckland City Hospital as a Medical Physics Registrar. During this period, he obtained his Master's degree in Medical Physics at the University of Canterbury.
